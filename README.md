# Meeting Reminder Landing Page

Simple static landing page that thanks the user for confirming a meeting and includes a Microsoft Teams logo plus GSAP animations.

Files added:
- `index.html` — the page (open in browser)
- `styles.css` — page styles
- `scripts.js` — GSAP animations

How to view:
Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use your editor's "Open in Browser"). The page uses the GSAP CDN and an externally-hosted Teams SVG.

Notes:
- If you want the Teams logo embedded locally instead of loading from Wikipedia, replace the `src` on the `<img>` in `index.html` with a local file path.
